  tutorialText: I'll be damned, this is one hungry fella. Some dietary needs are
    quite hard to satisfy, but seeing as we're the finest eatery in the galaxy we
    strive to always be prepared! Be careful that you don't choose a meal that the
    alien is allergic to, they will tell you what they can't eat when you take their
    order. +(Use 1,2,3 on your keyboard to select a dish from the list.)
