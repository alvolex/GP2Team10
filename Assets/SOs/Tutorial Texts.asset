  startString: On this fine day your duty is to serve as many of your alien brethren
    as possible. Travelers from all over the galaxy converge on this fine establishment
    to purchase some of the most sought after meals in the universe. +When a patron
    arrives, help them find an vacant table.
  howToSeatCustomers: To help patrons find their way to a table, simply walk up to
    them and interact with their group using (Spacebar), then find a suitable table
    and interact with it as well! (Spacebar)
  alienSeatedString: Well done, friend! You've successfully seated your first patrons,
    it's quite likely that they will, at some point, want to order some food. When
    that happens, take their order and try not to butcher them. Aliens are quite
    sensitive when it comes to their gastronomical needs.
  alienTakeOrderString: I'll be damned, this is one hungry fella. Some dietary needs
    are quite hard to satisfy, but seeing as we're the finest eatery in the galaxy
    we strive to always be prepared! Be careful that you don't choose a meal that
    the alien is allergic to, they will tell you what they can't eat when you take
    their order. +(Use 1,2,3 on your keyboard to select a dish from the list.)
  orderTakenString: Hopefully we managed to satisfy their dietary needs, we really
    couldn't afford another lawsuit.. Now let's scurry over to the kitchen and hand
    them the order, the quicker the better so that the chef's don't get overwhelmed!
  orderLeftAtKitchen: Fantastic work! Now the chef is cooking that delicious grub.
    Once the food is ready it will be delivered to the counter!
  foodAtTheCounterString: Although the chefs can be quite salty at times, their cooking
    abilities are top-notch when it comes to intergalactic dining. Be sure to deliver
    the order to the correct customer, post-haste!
  alienRecievedFoodString: Wow, you made it, my bet was that you'd quit before you
    managed to deliver your first order. Stay vigilant, some of these aliens will
    really test your patience!
